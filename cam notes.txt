CAM 5.2 30 May 2014

This release introduces a provisional breakdown of external assets
and liabilities and corresponding capital inflows and outflows between
direct investment, portfolio investment and other items (mainly banking). The historical databank has been updated to include 2012 and the model is aligned up to 2014 with WEO as of April 2014.

Breakdown of external assets and liabilities
============================================
Net external assets/liabilities in the existing model are given by
 NX$ = R$ + AXO$ - LX$
where R$  represents exchange reserves

Determination of these quantities in the model is not changed. The
current account surplus or deficit determines the net borrowing or
lending requirement and an 'openness' trend determines the size of
the balance sheet (total external assets vs total external liabilities).

What has been added is a breakdown of assets and liabilities determined
as above. The new variables are
 - external assets (breakdown of AXO$)
 ADO$  direct investment
 APO$  portfolio (bonds and equity)
 AOO$  other (bank deposits and other credits)
 - liabilities (breakdown of LX$)
 LDI$  direct investment
 LPI$  portfolio (bonds and equity)
 LOI$  other (bank borrowing and other debt)
and corresponding cash flows
 - net purchase of external assets (breakdown of IAXO$)
 IADO$  direct investment
 IAPO$  portfolio (bonds and equity)
 IAOO$  other (bank deposits and other credits)
 - net incurrence of external liabilities
 ILDI$  direct investment (breakdown of ILX$)
 ILPI$  portfolio (bonds and equity)
 ILOI$  other (bank borrowing and other debt)
The breakdown is modelled by determining direct investment and portfolio
assets and liabilities as proportions of the totals (AXO$ and LX$) and
other assets and liabilities as a remainder. If there is insufficient
capital inflow or if investors move money out the country may end up
with large banking liabilities. If there are large inflows banking
liabilities may be small but the inflows cannot be so large that banking
liabilities turn negative.

This approach distinguishes changes in the capital account that arise
on account of current account surpluses or deficits, a general increase
in openness (simultaneous increase in liabilities and assets) or a change
in the level of exchange reserves from those that arise from changes in
composition on each side of the balance sheet. The advantage is that
there is no immediate impact on the rest of the model. Impacts will arise
if and when we introduce explicit links in behavioural equations or
scenario assumptions (see sol1.prg for an example which carries through
to sol2.prg). 

These changes require modifications to WD.xls, SET.prg, DAT.prg,
EST.prg and ZDEF.prg as well as solution programs.

Land area and population density
================================
Land area (JLA) in sq.km. has been added as an indicator and land area
per capita (JLAN) in hectares has been added to model results and charts.


CAM 5.1 11 January 2014

This release updates 5.0 using data from WD6.33 and WEO October 2013.

The following European scenarios are defined:

N1  target growth of labour force and productivity
N2  austerity (baseline)
N3  industrial and location policy
N4  recovery programme: N3 + social policy

CAM 5.0 30 July 2013

This release provides a baseline projection and several European scenarios, generated by running programs in the following sequence:

  dat  est  sola  sol0p  sol0  solN1 solN2 solN3a
  solN3b solN3c

The scenarios all assume US and China collaboration in a general global context of reduced government.

The European scenarios represent
  N1  struggling on with austerity programmes
  N2  reflation to reduce unemployment
  N3x  reflation with rebalancing policies
    N3a  split of euro zone with super-euro for DE and PL
    N3b  income policies in euro zone
    N3c  industrial location policies (whole of Europe)

Databank and current-year alignment
===================================
This release uses a recently-updated global databank (WD 6.31) containing historical series up to 2011 and is aligned with WEO April 2013 projections for 2012-2014.

Note: WD6.31 includes many new series. Names of some existing series have been changed (see WD.xls for the mapping to CAM model variable names).

Bloc structure
==============
The bloc structure is based on the 19-bloc disaggregation used in the AUGUR project with 6 more countries identified individually making a total of 25 blocs. 

Europe is represented by
  6 countries: Germany, UK, France, Italy, Spain, Poland
  4 groups: North Europe, Other West Europe, Other South Europe and Other East Europe.

Turkey is distinguished separately from Other West Asia.

New variables
=============
Population, employment and unemployment are now disaggregated by sex and age group, distinguishing youth (age 15-24) and adult (25 and over). The measure of employment includes employees, self-employed, employers and family workers. Labour force is the sum of employment and unemployment.

Employment is further disaggregated by sex and broad sector (agriculture, industry and services).

GDP at market prices is analysed by type of income (labour income, corporate income and indirect taxes less subsidies) and by broad sector (agriculture, extraction, industry and services). Note that labour income here is a broad measure including compensation of employees, income from self-employment and rent and profits of households and unincorporated business. 

New policy indicators include
  NNE  economic dependency ratio
  VGA  agricultural productivity gap

The definition of government service standard (GSS) has been modified to exclude adults aged 25-64 from the target population.  

Model adjustments
=================
Behavioural equations model participation (labour force by sex and age group), unemployment by sex and age group, the breakdown of employment by sex and broad sector and the decomposition of GDP by broad sector and type of income.

Inflation: the cost of domestic output (GDP) is modelled by growth of average money earnings (ei), average output per person employed (GDP divided by total employment) and markups for corporate income and net indirect taxes. The price of domestic expenditure is modelled by an identity that incorporates terms of trade effects (import and export prices). Note that cyclical fluctuations in output per person employed are largely absorbed by corporate markups.

Savings and investment equations have been modified to respond to changes in the share of corporate income in GDP.

Real exchange rates have been modified to respond to growth performance and the world terms of trade for food and raw materials responds to the rate of growth of world demand rather than the level.

Programming
Some changes have been made to library routines and the process used to calculate model solutions to make simulation results consistent if different starting years are used. Note that this release includes a 'template' workfile MDS.wf1 used to initialise solutions.

CAM 4.6 AUGUR NOTES  7 May 2012

Governance scenarios
====================
Rebranded as E1 to E4 to give prominence to alternatives for Europe.
Variants E2a and E3a are also provided for analytic purposes (comparison of different European policies in the same global context).

BEWARE: the order of derivation is not intuitive.

Scenarios must be generated in the following order (see also XEC.prg):

  sol0p  plain projection
  sol0   baseline
  solE1  struggling on + reduced government
 *solE2a EU breakup + reduced government
 *solE2  EU breakup + US China hegemony
  solE4  multi-speed Europe + regionalisation
  solE3a towards Federal Europe + regionalisation 
  solE3  toward Federal Europe + multipolar collaboration

 * scenarios solE2 and solE2a diverge from solE1 after 2015
 other scenarios diverge from the baseline after 2012

Detailed assumptions have been adjusted in the light of the data update (base projection) and discussions at Brussels, Rome and Vienna. In solE3 and solE3a there is a federal European budget rising to 5% of GDP over 10 years.

See source code and "D1.5 appendix B and C" for technical details of assumptions for each scenario.


Model changes
=============
Adjusted equation for world price of raw materials (pa_w) reducing estimated sensitivity to long-run world demand. Provisionally the corresponding databank series (PXA) has been adjusted in WD.xls to maintain about the same level in dollar terms from 2010 onwards as in 2008.

Data update
===========
Databank updated for 2010 (WD6). Estimates for 2011-12 aligned with WEO April 2012.

CAM 4.5 AUGUR NOTES  30 Jan 2012

Model changes
=============
Addition of carbon tax as a policy instrument in all blocs. Requires modification of behavioural equations in est.prg and identities in zdef.prg

Addition of a multi-bloc budget system as a policy instrument. Library functions in mb.prg may be called to implement a multi-bloc budget in a scenario.

Migration equation adjusted to be more sensitive to employment opportunities and respond to per capita income.

Other program changes
=====================
Definitions of analysis tables moved from zrep.prg to a new module ztab.prg

New function SP_BuildTable in zrep.prg may be called to build presentation tables as well as the analysis tables in ztab.prg

See sol4.prg for examples of carbon tax and a multi-bloc budget. 
See present.prg for examples of usage of SP_BuildTable. 

Governance scenarios
====================
Modifications to the baseline and main scenarios S1 to S4. New variants scenarios S1A (EU breakup), S3A (Federal Europe) and S3B (Multi-speed Europe).

CAM 4.4 AUGUR NOTES  26 Sep 2011

Data corrections
================
A few corrections have been made to historical data in WD5_8.

Alignment update
=================
Data for 2010-12 are aligned with WEO September 2011 and monthly average oil prices reported by UNCTAD.

Baseline adjustments
====================
Addition of budget restrictions for all European blocs and credit restrictions for the UK and E Europe to reduce exchange rate risk.

Governance scenarios
====================
Scenarios 1-4 and 4a are implemented in a cumulative manner. 
Rules inherited from prior scenarios are dropped where necessary.
The final workfile SOL4a contains results for all scenarios.

The assumptions of each governance scenario have been modified (see scenario programs and D1.4.doc Appendix B).

Presentation graphs
====================
A new program D1_4 generates presentation graphs on additional pages in the SOL4a workfile.

Program changes
===============
A new utility DropRules is provided to cancel rules inherited from prior scenarios.

The implementation of Ceiling and Floor targets has been changed to ensure that instrument adjustments are not made if the objective remains within the given boundary values.

The SPGraph utility (zlibp.prg) has been improved with an argument allowing control of font size and an option to generate black-and-white graphs distinguishing series by line or shading style rather than colour.

CAM 4.3 AUGUR NOTES  29 Jul 2011

Model revision - migration equation
===================================
Sensitivity to employment has been reduced and working-age population has been dropped as an explanatory variable.

Baseline adjustments
=====================
Various adjustments have been made to improve plausibility (see sol0.prg).

An additional baseline (sol0a.prg) has been provided to demonstrate potential consequences of another recession centred on Europe taking effect around 2018.

Governance scenario revisions
=============================
Governance scenarios have been revised in response to comments on working paper D1.3 at the Poggio meeting and further suggestions by T McKinley and J Mazier.

Note: scenarios 3 and 4 have been renumbered so that the scenarios are in ascending order of performance / outcomes in terms of employment, development and sustainability
1 reduced government has the worst growth/employment outcome
2 China/US governance improves US employment and global balance to a limited extent
3 regionalisation generates more substantial growth and employment benefits through pro-active policies in four world regions (N America, Europe + CIS, W Asia + N Africa, E Asia). S America, Rest of Africa, India and Rest of S Asia are left as independent blocs not forming part of any larger grouping.
4 multipolar development generates larger and more widespread benefits through global cooperation to support development of low income blocs (Africa and S Asia) and reduce CO2 emissions.

Europe variants
===============
Variants to scenarios 1-3 show the impact of possible European adaptations to the global context defined by each scenario.

Fiscal transfer mechanism
=========================
A function has been provided in sol3a.prg to model a budget transfer scheme for Europe or any other grouping of blocs. This is used to represent a permanent system of fiscal transfers that takes account of income, population and the level of public debt in each bloc (group of countries) that is a member of the global grouping.

CAM 4.2 AUGUR NOTES  29 Apr 2011

World regions
=============
The programs have been rewritten to support aggregation of blocs into any number of regions, defined in set.prg.

The provisional aggregation for AUGUR combines 5 blocs representing different parts of Europe into a single European region and the remaining 14 blocs in the rest of the world into 4 continental regions (America, Africa, East Asia and Other Asia).

W Europe
========
Ireland has been included in the South Europe (EUS) bloc. The West Europe (EUW) bloc now includes the UK only.

Governance scenarios
====================
Four governance scenarios have been defined and simulated based on the provisional discussion at the Goa meeting.

Presentation charts
====================
A new library (zlibp.prg) has been provided to support production of presentation charts showing series for selected variables and blocs for one or many scenarios.

The program D1.3.prg contains the code specifying charts for use in the AUGUR WP1 deliverable D1.3.

CAM 4.1 AUGUR NOTES  29 Dec 2010
      
Base year 2005
==============
The base year has been changed in the databank and model programs (set.prg).

Simplified treatment of government capital account
====================================================
The gap between changes in government debt, net lending and investment in the banking system is treated as a capital transfer (IAGO) between government and non-government. No attempt is made to track the corresponding balance sheet item (AGO) as the data are too uncertain. 

Demography, employment and migration
=====================================
Historical data
 - new variables for child (NCP), working age (NWP) and old age (NOP) population, urbanisation (NUP), total employment (NE), net migration (NIM) and natural population change (DNN)
 - the employment rate (ratio of employment to working age population) is included in bloc policy scores, replacing capacity utilisation
 
Simulation
 - natural population change is exogenous (based on UN projections)
 - employment is a function of labour supply (working age and old age with reduced weight), urbanisation and changes in output, sensitivity to GDP being a function of per capita income. Bounds are imposed at 40% and 80% of the relevant population.
 - net migration is a function of changes in employment and working-age population
 
Other modifications to behavioural equations
============================================
 - government income (YG)
CA$ term added to make fiscal policy responsive to c/a as well as debt; removed insignificant terms (investment, energy exports, inflation) 
 - government spending (G)
add population term, remove insignificant inflation term
 - private investment (IP)
convert to logarithmic form with lower bound at 5% of prior year GDP remove holding gains terms (HKP)
 - valuation of external liabilities (rplx$)
add term for domestic asset price (pkp)
 - real exchange rate (rxu)
add terms for the external position (NX$) and global dollar inflation (PHW)
drop insignificant term on relative per capita income (only significant if fixed effects are discarded)
 - bond yield (im)
change from difference to levels equation
 - cost inflation (pvi)
add terms for the government financial balance (nlg) and asset prices (pkp)
combine impact of current and lagged capacity utilisation (v/vt)
 - price of export of manufactures (XM0)
remove wrongly-signed real exchange rate term and simplify to depend on lagged unit costs only
 
Multiplier tables
=================
These now include net migration as an input and asset prices, employment, employment rates and net migration as outputs.
 
Baseline adjustments (sol0)
=====================================
 - Eurozone: lock nominal exchange rates of Central Europe and South Europe
